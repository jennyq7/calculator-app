# Calculator App

This project used TypeScript, React, JavaScript, SASS to create a calculator.

## Getting Started with Create React App and TypeScript

I used the following command to start/create the project: 
```bash
  npx create-react-app [name of app] --template typescript
```
I used the above command to install both React and TypeScript together

### Additional installations:

```bash
  npm install sass
```

## Lessons I learned:

I learned how to build a calculator by following a tutorial on how to build a calculator with React. I amended the JavaScript with TypeScript instead. This was a very interesting experience as I had to figure out the types and it was not always clear. 
I also learned that the type name of an element in React is much more nested than regular JavaScript without React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
